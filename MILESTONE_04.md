## Description of research topics above with points

Implemented comprehensive unit tests using Mocha and Chai to validate Mongoose schemas for both `User` and `Post` models. Tests include required field checks, valid input handling, and edge case detection to ensure data integrity and schema enforcement.

Integrated `passport.js` with the `passport-local` strategy to enable user login authentication. Implemented session management using `express-session`, along with `serializeUser` and `deserializeUser` methods to maintain persistent login state across routes securely.
